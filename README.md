Laboratory work
In this project we try show our experience and attainments. This project will show main principles of OOP and our cooperation.
This program, are simulating small country, which have factories that produce resources 
and a market , where traders can trade. At all, some kind of factory produce instruments.
All factories need  new instruments, and it this moment this model closes in itself. 
All starting variables are choose in program and user cant change nothing.

First diagram show our main building where is happen all actions. The name of this building is ResourceBuilding. 
It contain information about our country, instruments and other.
 Main functions of this diagram show what will be hierarchy of our country and apportion work about us. 
 Also it help construct plan for future.

Our second diagram show how will work market. How will be work main functions and trades.
 It will contain all information about money and operation with money. 
 Also there will be trader which will create proposition for country, daily proposition and other financial trade.
As conclusion first diagram show our main information about our country and actions with instrument, second diagram show all financial actions.
We think that this projects can show our skills. And we will increase our knowledge about java.
In future we will add some Hibernate, and use tomcat or another server.
